# Contributing to Adversarial Apps Web Application

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Below you'll find guidelines for contributing and how to do so.

## Make Issue

Found a bug? Have a new feature want to add? First, make an issue on the repository using the appropriate template. Go to issues, new issue, pick template based on what type you are creating, and then fill out the template.

Once you submit issue, move to the next phase.

## Work on Code

Assign your self to an open issue and begin work on it. 

First, create a branch linked to the issue. Go to the issue you are working on, and on the right hand side that contains Assignee there is a Development field which says Create A Branch and click on those words.

This will create a branch on the issue. However you need to do two things in the menu.

- change branch name to be issue/1-name-of-issue
- Ensure the source of branch is development
    - THIS IS KEY. Your source must be from development and not main otherwise won't have latest changes on issue branch based on development progress

Once you have the branch created you can use Git to check it out locally and begin working on the files. 

## Submitting Pull Request

Once your work has been completed you will then need to do a few things.

Run the linter, so that project is linted and formatted to good coding standards.

Create a pull request. Fill out the pull request template that is provided and then request the review of all team mates. 

Once at least 1 other collaborator reviews the code works on their end and is formatted correctly, no errors, spelling mistakes, etc. then they can approve and merge it into development branch. 

NOTE: All issue branches will be merged into development. To merge development into main, a pull request must be created and review by all project admins. If they all agree then will go to main. This should happen rarely and only when development is stable, usually after a large feature completion.
