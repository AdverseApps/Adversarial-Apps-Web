            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pl-5"><br />What is it?</h2>
            <p className = "pl-5">The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology 
                Transfer (STTR) programs exist to support America&apos;s small defense businesses so that they may 
                have greater means to access necessary funding in a competitive environment. The Due Diligence 
                program was created by the U.S. Department of Defense as a follow-up to these programs for the 
                purposes of screening potential candidates. Their aim is to ensure that these small businesses 
                follow guidelines that minimize their risk factor to national security concerns.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pl-5"><br />What is required of a company to be assessed by the 
                Due Diligence program?</h2>
            <p className = "pl-5">The Department of Defense Due Diligence program has several components 
                that small business concerns (SBCs) must comply with to be considered for SBIR or STTR candidacy. 
                The program components consist of:</p>
            <ol className = "pl-10"><br />
                <li>    A. The submission of a completed, SBA-approved &quot;Disclosures of Foreign Affiliations or 
                        Relationships to Foreign Countries&quot; form,</li>
                <li>    B. A review based on publicly available information (PAI) and commercially available 
                        information (CAI) if the candidate seeks a support agreement with the Air Force,</li>
                <li>    C. A Due Diligence review to assess security risks,</li>
                <li>    D. A counterintelligence review if the SBC has any foreign ownership control or influence (FOCI),</li>
                <li>    E. And will undergo a risk mitigation review board to assess potential risk factors.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className = "pl-5"><br />The Department of Defense will not grant awards to companies that they deem 
                to pose an unacceptable security risk that cannot reasonably be mitigated. </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pl-5"><br />What criteria prohibits award reception for SBIR and STTR proposals?</h2>
            <p className = "pl-5">The Department of Defense cannot grant awards to candidates if the SBC, 
                its parent company or its subsidiary:</p>
            <ol className = "pl-10"><br />

                <li>    B. has an owner or covered individual with relations to a foreign research 
                        institution in a FCOC; or</li>
                <li>    C. has an owner or covered individual partied with a malign foreign talent 
                        recruitment program (MFTRP); AND</li>
            </ol>
            <p className = "pl-5"><br />The nature of the relationships stated above cannot:</p>
            <ol className = "pl-10"><br />
                <li>    A. interfere with the Department of Defense&apos;s capacity to carry out 
                        activities the Department supports,</li>
                <li>    B. create duplication with DoD-supported activities,</li>
