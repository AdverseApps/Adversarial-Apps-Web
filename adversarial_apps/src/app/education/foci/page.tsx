            <p className = "pl-5"><br />FOCI is an important part of ensuring compliance with CFR Title 15. In 
                FOCI, ownership generally refers to beneficial ownership of the business. A beneficial 
                owner of a security &mdash; in this case a business &mdash; includes any person who 
                directly or indirectly through any contract arrangement, understanding, relationship, or 
                otherwise has or shares any of the following:</p>
            <p className = "pl-10"><ol><br />
                <li>    1. Voting power, which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security; or</li>
                <li>    2. Investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security.</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p className = "pl-5"><br />In this case, security just means ownership of a portion of the business. 
                Voting power involves any decisions an owner might make about business operations, regardless 
                of whether that power is being actively exercised.</p>
