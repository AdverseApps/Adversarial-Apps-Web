        <p className = "pl-5">A CFR stands for Code of Federal Regulations and contains 
            all the codes and regulations published by the government 
            from various departments.</p>

        <p className = "pl-5"><br />What this law does is that it extends SBIR and STTR awards 
            till 2025 instead of ending in 2022 which is what it was set to originally. 
            More importantly to our project, it also established the Due Diligence Program. 
            This program was established to assess the security risks associated with cybersecurity 
            practices, patents, foreign adversaries and ownership, employees, and more for small businesses seeking awards 
            through these programs for each federal head in charge of that process. It further requires that each small business 
            disclose certain information in regard to foreign adversaries such as the ownership percentage for foreign adversaries, 
            patent processing in foreign countries, etc.</p>
