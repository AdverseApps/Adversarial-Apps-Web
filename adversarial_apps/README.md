This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Unit Testing

Unit Testing is in GitHub Actions so testing locally isn't required.

To allow for local testing. You must first install jest:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

To run the testing environment locally, you can run:
```
npm run test
```
this will run all active tests in the "tests" directory.
Expected to work out the box with `package.json`, `jest.setup`, and `jest.config` being up-to-date.

To investigate individual tests, you can run:
```
npm run test-watch
```
You can follow the prompts to decrease the scope of the tests.
